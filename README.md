# #Genuary2023

My 2nd year of Genuary! Generative art made for Genuary 2023: https://genuary.art/

R is my language of choice for creative coding, but I'm thinking of trying p5.js at some point for this year's challenge...

Check out last year's pieces here: :computer: https://github.com/jacquietran/genuary_2022
